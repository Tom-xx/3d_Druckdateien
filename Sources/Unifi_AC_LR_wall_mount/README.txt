# Summary

I printed mine laying as provided in the file. That makes the two wall mounting holes vulnerable to layer separation, but I post baked those areas with hot air.

If you are worried about the layer bonding strength, the part can be printed standing on the wall side, with supports in the holes.

Anyway, the mount is meant to wall mount a UAP-AC-LR horizontally on a wall, where the roof won't allow a horizontal mount (slanted roof). The part mounts the wall plate with M3 bolts. The funky arched slot is to allow the cable to pass through and the AP twisted onto the mount.
